__An everyday local development environment for PHP Developers.__ At [Pivotal Agency](https://www.pivotalagency.com.au/), we've done a _buuunnnch_ of R&D to find the best local dev tools for our team. This is the result of our hard work. This tool has been put to its paces everyday by our team, we hope it can also help yours.

---

## Intro 👋

This is a set of Docker images to spin up a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP) for developing locally. It's perfect for local development because you can very simply add new sites to specified directory and they're magically accessible as a subdomain of your chosen hostname (eg. eg. `~/projects/example` maps to `http://example.localhost/`).

It includes all the required dependencies for everyday PHP development with common tools like Laravel, Wordpress and Magento (1 & 2). Specifically:

**Default Services**

- Apache (including HTTPS)
- PHP 8.2
    - Composer (latest)
    - Node.js (latest LTS) & NPM (latest)*
    - Yarn (latest of 1.x)*
    - PHPCS (with Wordpress code standards added)*
    - Wordpress CLI*
    - ZSH*
- Mailpit (latest)
- MariaDB 10.3

<p><i>* Available in latest 2x PHP containers</i></p>

**Optional Services**

- PHP 5.6, all 7.x and all 8.x
- Memcached 1.x
- Redis 7.x
- [Blackfire](https://blackfire.io/) (latest)

These optional services (eg. PHP 5.6, PHP 7.4) can be added in the `.env` file by appending them to the `COMPOSE_FILE` option. See `.env.example` for an example of the syntax.

**Domain Mapping**

The environment features clever *domain mapping* to allow you to run code for various platforms. Sites are accessible from the following URLs (by default it's `http://<folder>.localhost`, however `APACHE_HOSTNAME` can modified in `.env` to point to a different hostname):

* __http://classic-php.php56.localhost__
    * Will map to `~/projects/classic-php` and use PHP 5.6
* __http://laravel.php74.pub.localhost__
    * Will map to `~/projects/laravel/public` and use PHP 7.4
* __http://another-project.localhost__
    * Will map to `~/projects/another-project` and use the default version of PHP

## Prerequisites ⚠️

You'll first need to install Docker Desktop (or Docker on Linux).


---

## Installation 🚀

> Windows Users: The Docker Dev containers perform best while running inside WSL2. We'll assume you will run these commands in a WSL2 terminal (eg. Ubuntu).

1. Open a terminal window
2. Create a new folder for your projects
```
mkdir ~/projects
cd ~/projects
```
**Note**: The `~/` alias points to your home folder (eg. `/home/USERNAME/`)

3. Clone this repo into your projects folder
```
git clone git@github.com:pvtl/docker-dev.git
cd docker-dev
```
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set the `DOCUMENTROOT` to your projects folder (eg. `/home/USERNAME/projects/`)
5. Build and start the Docker containers:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

For ease of use we recommend you also set up the [Daily Shortcuts](https://github.com/pvtl/docker-dev/#daily-shortcuts-%EF%B8%8F).

You can test if your Docker Dev environment is working correctly using a simple PHP info file.

1. Create the folder and file: `/home/USERNAME/projects/test/index.php`
1. Edit the file and paste `<?php phpinfo();`
1. In your browser, open http://test.localhost. You should see the PHP info page.



---

## Updating 🔄

Open a terminal window, browse to this project's folder and run:

```bash
# 1. Fetch our latest updates
git pull

# 2. Erase previous containers. Your project files and DB's will be left as-is.
docker-compose down --remove-orphans

# 3. Get latest docker images
docker-compose pull

# 4. Rebuild Dockerfiles from scratch (inc. pull parent images)
docker-compose build --pull --no-cache --parallel

# 5. Start the updated environment
docker-compose up -d --remove-orphans

# 6. Erase any unused containers, images, volumes etc. to free disk space.
docker system prune --volumes
```

*This will also install the latest versions of all tools (eg. PHP, Redis, Node.js etc.)*

---

## Daily Shortcuts ⚡️

While the above commands work, they're a bit tedious to type out on a daily basis. You can set up terminal aliases to make life easier.

If you use ZSH, edit `~/.zshrc`. Otherwise edit `~/.bashrc`. Create the file if it doesn't exist.

1. Paste the code (below) at the bottom of the file. Adjust your folder path to suit.
1. Close and re-open your terminal to apply the changes
1. Try running `devup` or `devdown`

```
# Usage: "devup" or "devdown"
alias devup='(cd /home/USERNAME/projects/docker-dev && docker compose start)'
alias devdown='(cd /home/USERNAME/projects/docker-dev && docker compose stop)'

# Usage (for PHP 8.1): "devin 81"
# Simply change the numbers for your preferred PHP version (assuming it's installed/enabled)
devin() {
  docker exec -it php$1 bash
}
```

## Common Commands 🔥

Docker must be running and these commands must be run from the Docker Dev folder (eg. `/home/USERNAME/projects/docker-dev`).

Most of these actions can also be done in the Docker Desktop app.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `docker-compose start` | Start all containers |
| `docker-compose stop`  | Stop all containers (keeps any config changes you've made to the containers) |
| `docker-compose up -d --build --no-cache` | Recreate all containers from scratch |
| `docker-compose down`  | Tear down all containers (MySQL data and project folders are kept) |
| `docker-compose exec php80-fpm zsh`  | Open a zsh terminal in the PHP 8.0 container |
| `docker-compose logs php80-fpm` | View all logs for PHP-FPM 8.0 |
| `docker-compose ps` | Show which containers are running |
